# xwjson

**Binary JSON plus local data-engine behavior for real workloads.** `.xwjson` is powered by the `xwsystem` parser engine for high-throughput reads/writes, lazy and path-scoped access, schema-aware validation, encrypted payload support, and **atomic-first ACID-style transaction flows with WAL**. In this repo, performance/stress suites include large-file scenarios validated up to 20GB, stdlib JSON comparisons, and conversion stress runs.

## Install

```bash
pip install exonware-xwjson
pip install exonware-xwjson[lazy]
pip install exonware-xwjson[full]
```

---

## Quick start

```python
from exonware.xwjson import XWJSONSerializer

serializer = XWJSONSerializer()
# Async (recommended)
data = await serializer.load_file_async("data.xwjson")
await serializer.save_file_async(data, "output.xwjson")
# Sync
data = serializer.load_file("data.xwjson")
serializer.save_file(data, "output.xwjson")
```

See [docs/](docs/) for REF_*, guides, and examples.

## What you get

| Area | What's in it |
|------|----------------|
| **Binary engine** | `xwsystem` parser-driven binary encoding with fast serialization paths and metadata-aware payloads. |
| **Lazy + path I/O** | Parse on access, stream/paging support, and path-level operations without full materialization. |
| **References** | `$ref`, `@href`, `*anchor` preserved and resolved. |
| **Security** | Password-based encrypted file support and encrypted payload detection helpers. |
| **Atomic operations** | Atomic read/write/update/delete paths for safe state transitions under concurrent workloads. |
| **Transactions** | ACID-style flows with WAL-backed transaction components, rollback support, and dependency-aware batch work. |
| **Index/cache acceleration** | xwnode strategy integrations for faster lookups and cache-assisted repeated access. |
| **Integration** | xwnode, xwschema, xwquery, xwdata, xwstorage; format metadata carried through. |

---

## Atomic operations - core strength

- `xwjson` is designed around atomic state changes, not best-effort updates.
- Single-file and path-level operations are built to commit safely or fail safely.
- Transaction flows combine atomic steps with WAL-backed durability mechanics.
- For local data-engine workloads, this is a headline capability: **atomic operations are first-class, not optional**.

---

## Performance and benchmark posture

- Built-in performance guidance and benchmark methodology: `docs/_archive/GUIDE_PERFORMANCE.md`.
- Repo test artifacts include conversion/performance stress suites and large-file scenarios in `tests/2.integration/scenarios/`.
- File size note: no hard file-size cap is enforced by `xwjson`; largest documented test scenario in this repo is 20GB.
- Test summaries in `tests/FINAL_TEST_SUMMARY.md` and `tests/TEST_SUMMARY.md` document speed-oriented targets (including stdlib JSON comparison paths and cache/index speedups).
- Positioning: `xwjson` can act like a **database-like local data layer** for many workloads; external database claims should stay workload-specific and benchmark-backed.

## Ecosystem functional contributions

`xwjson` is a serialization and local data-engine layer; sibling libs provide the runtime, validation, query, and persistence ecosystem around it.
You can use `xwjson` standalone as a high-performance binary JSON and local data-engine option.
Using more XW libraries is optional and most valuable for enterprise and mission-critical deployments where you want fully controlled infrastructure around schema, query, and storage.

| Supporting XW lib | What it provides to xwjson | Functional requirement it satisfies |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **XWSystem** | Parser/codec/runtime foundation for binary JSON engine behavior and shared helpers. | High-performance, consistent serializer runtime across stack packages. |
| **XWNode** | Index/cache and structure-oriented acceleration paths for repeated data access. | Faster structured lookups and navigation over complex payloads. |
| **XWSchema** | Schema-aware validation hooks for loaded/transformed data. | Data contract integrity during local JSON-engine operations. |
| **XWQuery** | Query execution over xwjson-backed in-memory payloads. | Declarative filtering/aggregation without custom traversal code. |
| **XWData** | Data-model and conversion workflows that consume xwjson input/output. | Cross-format data pipeline interoperability. |
| **XWStorage** | Persistence abstraction using xwjson as local/default serialization format in storage scenarios. | Durable state management and backend portability with predictable on-disk format. |

Competitive edge: `xwjson` combines binary JSON performance with transaction/atomic semantics and first-class integration into query, schema, and storage layers.
